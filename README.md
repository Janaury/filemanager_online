# filemanager_online
A simple php online filemanager
##let's get started
This is a very simple php filemanager, and just offers some basic functions. In addition, the structure of the small project is not \
well-organized.but I'm trying to improve it.
---
##I'll introduce all the files in the project.
1. index.php
   This file is used to display a user interface. But I put almost all the data-processing codes in it in the first version, \
   and I am trying to move it to "data.php" which I plan to use for processing background data.
